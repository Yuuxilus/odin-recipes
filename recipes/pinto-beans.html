            <li>Put the rinsed beans into the pressure cooker. Add the olive oil to prevent foaming. Add the onion and the garlic. Cover with hot water—3 inches above the level of the beans.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and season the beans with the spices.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot to pressure and cook for the allotted time</li>
            <li>Test a bean to make sure it is tender to your liking. If the beans need to cook more, bring to pressure again for a minute or so.</li>
